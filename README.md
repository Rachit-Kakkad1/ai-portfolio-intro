 #⚡ AI-Powered Portfolio Intro

![Banner](banner.png)
> 🧠 “Chat with my digital twin!”  
> Meet my **AI-powered portfolio assistant** — a conversational chatbot that introduces me, talks about my skills, and shares my projects.  
> Currently built as a standalone demo, soon to be integrated into my full personal portfolio website.

---

## 🌟 Highlights
- 💬 **Conversational Interface:** Ask anything about me or my work — the AI answers like a friendly version of me.  
- 🧩 **Data-Driven:** Uses a `data.json` file to store my skills, about info, and projects.  
- ⚡ **Powered by OpenAI:** Context-aware, natural language responses.  
- 🎨 **Clean Frontend:** Built with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- 🔒 **Secure API Setup:** Optional Node.js backend to safely handle the API key.

## 🧠 What It Does
The AI acts as my personal assistant.  
You can ask:
> “Who is Rachit Kakkad?”  
> “What projects has Rachit built?”  
> “What skills does he have?”  
> “What’s next in his learning journey?”

It reads from a structured data file and answers dynamically using the OpenAI API.
