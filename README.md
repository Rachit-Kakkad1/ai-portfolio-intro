# ⚡ AI-Powered Portfolio Intro

> 🧠 “Chat with my digital twin!”  
> Meet my **AI-powered portfolio assistant** — a conversational chatbot that introduces me, talks about my skills, and shares my projects.  
> Currently built as a standalone demo, soon to be integrated into my full personal portfolio website.

---

## 🌟 Highlights
- 💬 Conversational interface that talks about me and my work  
- 🧩 Uses a `data.json` file to store my skills, about info, and projects  
- ⚡ Powered by OpenAI for context-aware responses  
- 🎨 Built with clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- 🔒 Optional Node.js backend for API key protection

## 🧠 What It Does
You can ask:
> “Who is Rachit Kakkad?”  
> “What projects has Rachit built?”  
> “What skills does he have?”  
> “What’s next in his learning journey?”

The AI assistant reads from structured data and responds dynamically using the OpenAI API.
